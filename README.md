# Bingo Generator (Revamp)

## Demo & Snippets


---

## Requirements / Purpose
Girls Programming Network have Bingo Cards they use for their morning games and functions as an icebreaker between the girls/ gender diverse individuals.
 I volunteered to create new prompts and creating a new card each workshop. However, finding unqiue prompt can take time and difficult to recreate for others that want to use bingo at their GPN workshops. 
To solve this I will create a bingo card generator full-stack SPA. 

Features: 


Tech Stack: 
Front-End: 
Typescript, 
React, 
Playwright Testing 

Backend:
Java 
Spring
Spring testing
MYSQL
cloud hosting - TBD

## Additional Details

-   This is a reimplemenatation of an old project I began before going through the _nology training program.
- I want to rebuild it into a full-stack application rather than a front-end application using the languages and frameworks I learnt. 
- I want to add a database to store the prompts instead of keeping the data into a static object on the front-end.
